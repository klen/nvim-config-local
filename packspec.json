    "summary": "Secure load local config files",
    "detailed": "Vim provides a feature called exrc, which allows to use config files that are local to the current working directory. However, unconditionally sourcing whatever files we might have in our current working directory can be potentially dangerous. Because of that, neovim has disabled the feature. The plugin tries to solve this issue by keeping track of file hashes and allowing only trusted files to be sourced.",
